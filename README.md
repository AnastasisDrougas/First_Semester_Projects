## 1. Periodic Table Program

### Description:
A C-based program that allows users to search for individual elements or groups of elements in the periodic table. It is ideal for educational purposes due to its simplicity and user-friendly interface. Users can easily explore the elements of the periodic table, learning details such as atomic number, symbol, atomic mass, and name.

### Features:
- Search individual elements for detailed information.
- Search by group, with highlighted groups in the periodic table.

## 2. Julian & Gregorian Calendar (year 0 to 9999)

### Description:
This C program is a simple calendar utility that allows the user to input a year and an optional month, and it prints out a calendar for that year or month. Overall, this program is a useful tool for displaying a formatted calendar for any given year and month, with careful attention to historical and leap year intricacies.

### Features:
- Print a Single Month Calendar: The user can input a specific month, and the program will display the calendar for that month.
- Print the Entire Year Calendar: If the user enters "0" for the month, the program will print the entire calendar for the given year, displaying all 12 months in a grid format.
